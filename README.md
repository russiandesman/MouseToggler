# MouseToggler

Tool to reverse mouse buttons and cursor pointers in one click

## Why?

If you move your mouse from right to left hand time after time, you noticed that doing this via settings page is not very convenient

Also right-handed cursors look counter-intuitive when you use your left hand

Setting cursors scheme/theme standard way is even more cumbersome

So here we are -- install this tool and click on desktop icon -- it will switch mouse buttons AND cursor scheme

Three icons are provided -- for standard, large and XL cursor sizes
